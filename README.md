# Helm-Advanced ðŸš€

This repository demonstrates **advanced Helm usage** by combining:

- **Helmfile** â€“ manage multiple Helm releases
- **Hooks** â€“ run certain tasks based on even (pre deploy, post deploy etc..)
- **Helm Tests** â€“ validate deployments after install/upgrade

The goal of this project is to simulate **real-world Helm workflows** step by step.
